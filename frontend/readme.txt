  Notes for Code Style:
    - Use const keyword wherever suitable
    - Write propTypes as often as possible
    - Two space indent for javascript
    - Extract styles and constants outside of render functions
    - Keep return render function brief for readabilitiy
      - Extract logical blocks outside
    - Alphabetize destructures and dictionaries in general
    - I prefer concision over verbosity (but this is your choice)
      - but use descriptive variable names
    - Keep import statements logically grouped
    - Keep destructure statements at beginning of function
    - Keep lines shorter than 80 characters, give or take
